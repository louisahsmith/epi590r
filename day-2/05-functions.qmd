## Exercises

1. Square a number. You're tired of writing `x^2` when you want to square `x`, so you want a function to square a number. You can call it `square()`. I showed this in the slides, now try on your own!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# start out with a number to test
x <- 3
# you'll want your function to return this number
x^2
square <- function() {
  
}
# test it out
square(x)
square(53)
53^2 # does this match?
```
