## Exercises

1. Write a function to raise to any power. You don't just want to square numbers, you want to raise them to higher powers too. Make a function that uses two arguments, `x` for a number, and `power` for the power. Call it `raise()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
raise <- function() {
  
}

# test with
raise(x = 2, power = 4)
# should give you
2^4
```

2. Change your `raise()` function to default to squaring `x` when the user doesn't enter a value for `power`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# test
raise(x = 5)
# should give you
5^2
```
