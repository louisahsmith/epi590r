format: html

Open the slides in a new tab [here](slides/07-functions3.qmd){target="_blank"}.

<div>

```{=html}
<iframe class="slide-deck" src="slides/07-functions3.html"></iframe>
```

</div>

## Exercises

1. Fit the models from the slides.
2. Using the function from the slides, create a table for each model. What types of situations would this be useful for, and when would it not?
3. Add an argument to the function that allows someone to add robust standard errors (see the `tidy_fun = ` argument from the regression exercise solutions yesterday).
